## About
PlatePlanner is a full-stack node.js based application.  The purpose of PlatePlanner is to be able to search for recipes, save favorite recipes to the profile while also saving the ingredients from that receipe to the shopping list.  

With a responsive design built with Bootstrap, the shopping list can be retrieved from your mobile device while in the store to ensure you have all the ingredients needed for a particular recipe. 

The profile page saves the full URL link to the recipe so a user can go back to the recipe at any time as needed. 


## Install
1. Please ensure node.js is installed on your computer
2. Once node is installed, download the application onto the computer and ensure the package.json is intact.  
3.  As long as the package.json is intact, a npm i (aka npm install) on the command line should install all the appropriate modules.   Please reference the below dependency list to verify install
4. Please make sure to register for a unique API key at [Food to Fork API](https://www.food2fork.com/about/api "Food to Fork API ")
5. Add a process.env file and add Key = (Unique API goes here)
6. The application utilizes the Key for several different api calls throughout the app, so it is necessary to have for proper operation of app. 
7. Once modules are installed and API is added through the process.env file you are able to start the server (node server.js) in the command line. 
8. Please note that Food to Fork API only allows 50 API calls per day, so searching the app once or twice, will negate the use of that API Key for the remainder of the day.

####Facebook Authentication

Facebook Authentication works, though the code has been commented out as it is believed some of the functionality of the API does not work with that code active. 

####Facebook Connect Requirements- Terms & Privacy Policy
In order for Facebook Connect to work live, they require both a terms & conditions policy as well as a privacy policy
