# PlatePlanner
## About
PlatePlanner is a node.js based application.  The purpose of PlatePlanner is to be able to search for recipes, save favorite recipes to the profile while also saving the ingredients from that receipe to the shopping list.  

With a responsive design built with Bootstrap, the shopping list can be retrieved from your mobile device while in the store to ensure you have all the ingredients needed for a particular recipe.
